HI Divya 
I will show you the steps to add stuff to the menus table. 
This is the table that controls the UI
Step 1: Change the dmd_data.sql file to add what you want for the UI
Step 2: I have added contactpage in one of the fields in the sql file. It is not in the old database but we will see it added in the new database file
Step 3: Looking at the old database: sqlite3 awareclient.db.OLD
Step 4: TO view tables type ".tables" in the prompt
Step 5: to query any of the tables type "select * from <tablename>"
Step 6: We saw the first record in the menus table in the old databse was |Family Member and Primary Care Giver Information|DMDAid|custompage|FAMINFO
Step 7: Instead of "custompage" i added contact page in that field in the dmd_data.sql file
Step 8: Now creating the .db file from the edited dmd_data.sql file will show us the modified table
Step 9: creating the new database "awareclient.db" from the .sql file. (make sure the file "awareclient.db" does not already exist in the directory. That is why i renaled the old file to awareclient.db.OLD).. So the command is "sqlite3 awareclient.db < dmd_data.sql"
Step 10: repeat step 3,4,5 to confirm the edited table in the new database
